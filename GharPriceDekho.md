## Introduction

When someone wants to buy his/her own house it is very difficult for that person to know the expected price range of house as per their requirement.

This is reason behind to develop this project to solve this problem and make people life easy that anyone can able to knows the price of house with 95% accuracy according to their requirements.


## Problems faced during buying a house:

• Buying a house is a stressful thing.\
• Buyers are generally not aware of factors that influence the house prices.\
• Many problems are faced during buying a house.\
• Hence real estate agents are trusted with the communication between buyers and sellers\
as well as laying down a legal contract for the transfer. This just creates a middle man
and increases the cost of houses.

## My Motivation and Goal


• Providing all the relevant factors which genuinely affect the price of the house.\
• Saving the money, time and efforts which is wasting nowadays on broker.\
• It also saves the user from fraud broker and builder which put them into a very difficult
situation.\
• Removing the fear of the people to buy his/her own properties with 99.9% credibility by
using my application.
